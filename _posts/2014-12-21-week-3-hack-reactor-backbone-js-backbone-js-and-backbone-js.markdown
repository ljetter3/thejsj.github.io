Here's some of the projects I worked on at Hack Reactor during week #3. Each project was done in a 2 days sprints were I pair-programmed with someone from my cohort.

### BlackJack

I worked with Tony on this Blackjack client. You start with $1000 and increase and decrease your bet as you go. I spent a lot of time on the UI and I'm pretty happy with the way it looks. Most of the time was spent creating the logic for the Backbone.js models, views and collections.

### ChatterBox Client

As way to dive into Backbone.js, AJAX and browser security we made a chat client that uses the Parse API. The client has multiple rooms (Backbone collections) and the ability to add messages (Backbone Models).

The third Backbone project this week! We built a worked playing client side app. After implementing the logic for the playlist and library, we worked on making an audio visualizer using the Web Audio API.
