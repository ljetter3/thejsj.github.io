- L is an attempt to find the limits between the self and the other
- L is the realization that, in the end, we’re all truly alone
- L is the mystery of not knowing what you’re getting yourself into
- L is a decision we consciously make to include someone else in your life, even after the euphoria of “love” is gone
- L is having a conversation and finding out something about yourself that completely who you think you are
- L is trusting someone completely and blindly around every corner of yourself
- L is laying in bed for hours and hours and hours without practically and not understanding how time went by so quickly
- L is feeling so comfortable with someone that you allow yourself to be more mad than you ever thought possible
- L is waiting at a restaurant for hour and a half because they were late and finding yourself unable to get mad at them
- L is knowing exactly how someone will react, even before they do
- L is the unglamorous, inevitable process of seeing some get old, fat, and boring
- L is losing L and feeling like you lost the most important part of yourself
